# Availability is either critical (=true) or non-critical (=false). Critical
# means: If the data provided by this service is *lost* (or not available for
# longer than a day) then a core business process is negatively affected. For
# example: If single-sign-on authentication is down, then login is partially
# impossible and multiple business processes are affected. The value is made
